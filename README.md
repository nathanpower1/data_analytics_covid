# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

This project involves the analysis of COVID-19 data obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The dataset includes multiple CSV files containing cleaned COVID-19 data, along with auxiliary files such as a data quality report, a data quality plan, and a Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis code.

## Dataset

- **CDC_COVID_1-1_cleaned.csv**: Cleaned COVID-19 data.
- **CDC_COVID_1-2_cleaned.csv**: Another set of cleaned COVID-19 data.
- **CDC_COVID_1-3_cleaned_new_features.csv**: Enhanced version of the cleaned data with additional features.
- **covid19-cdc-19311361.csv**: Main dataset containing COVID-19 data.
- **categoricalFeatureDescription.csv**: Description of categorical features.

## Reports and Documentation

- **Data Quality Report.pdf**: A report detailing the quality of the COVID-19 dataset.
- **Data_Quality_Plan.pdf**: Plan outlining the steps taken to ensure the quality of the dataset.

## Analysis Notebook

- **Nathan_Power_19311361_Homework1.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis code for the COVID-19 data.

## Usage

1. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the CSV files containing the COVID-19 data.
3. Review the data quality report and plan for insights into the dataset's quality.
4. Execute the analysis code provided in the Jupyter Notebook to perform further analysis or generate insights from the data.
